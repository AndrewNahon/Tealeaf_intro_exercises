#1. Write a program that contains a method called 
#greeting that takes a name as its parameter. 
# It then prints a greeting message with the name included 
#in it.

def greeting(name)
	puts "Hello #{name}. How are you today?"
end

=begin
What do the following expressions evaluate to?

1. x = 2  => Evaluates to 2.  

2. puts x = 2  ==> Evaluates to nil

3. p name = "Joe"  ==> Evaluates to "Joe"

4. four = "four" ==> Evaluates to "four"

5. print something = "nothing" ==> Evaluates to nil
=end

=begin
def multiply(a, b)
	a * b
end

p multiply(10, 2)
=end

#4 The code will not print anything. The method stops
# evaluating before it reaches the 'puts words' code
#because of the inclusion of 'return' in the method.
